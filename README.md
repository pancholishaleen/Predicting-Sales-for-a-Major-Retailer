# Predicting-Sales-for-a-Major-Retailer
Had implemented Machine Learning Algortihms using Python in Jupyter Notebook to read macro economics data for a Major Retailer over the years since 2010 and the corresponding sales over these years. Using this input data, the data was standardized and normalized, imputations were applied and Principal Component Analysis was done to identify the major contributors that impacted the sales directly and had direct correlation with the sales figures.
